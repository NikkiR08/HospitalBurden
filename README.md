# PLEASE USE THE MOST UP-TO-DATE BRANCH (PLOS-one) FOR THE CODE UTILISED IN THE PLOS ONE MANUSCRIPT [NOT MASTER]
Code utilised to clean and analyse data in order to estimate the health and cost burden of infections.
This code builds upon previous work to estimate the mortality, length of stay and cost burden of resistant and susceptible Escherichia coli bloodstream infections in England.
This work is part of my PhD project funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance at Imperial College London in partnership with Public Health England (PHE). The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, the Department of Health or Public Health England. More information on HPRU and current projects can be found on https://www1.imperial.ac.uk/hpruantimicrobialresistance/.

Please utilise the Codebook ("Codebook-2019.pdf") and the data dictionary (Data Dictionary - Github.pdf) provided in this repository.
